                London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. The city stands on the River Thames in
                 the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major
                  settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core and
                   financial centre − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains
                    boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits. The adjacent City of Westminster
                     is an Inner London borough and has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty one
                      additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. London is governed by the mayor of
                       London and the London Assembly.<br><br>
                London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been called the world's
                 most powerful, most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, sustainable,
                  most investment-friendly, and most-popular-for-work city. It exerts a considerable impact upon the arts,
                   commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development,
                    tourism and transportation. London ranks 26th out of 300 major cities for economic performance. It is one 
                    of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or the sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP.
                     It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest city airport system as measured by
                      passenger traffic. It is the leading investment destination,  hosting more international retailers
                       than any other city. As of 2020, London has the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after Moscow.
                        In 2019, London had the highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe. London's universities form the
                         largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and London is home to highly ranked institutions such
                          as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, and the London School of Economics in social sciences.
                           In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.
